Logic for Association mining Java application:
This app requires support of weka library which needs the data to be in specific format
before weka library can use that. Hence information collected has to transformed in
arff format.
In arff format every item has a fix index in the data and in each entry of data that
item is either present at same index or a '?' is used.
So each changed file will require to have an index.

1. get
    revs: a list of all the revisions and
    create a HashMap called indexMap to store indexing of each changed file
2. for every revision in revs{
      a. get list of changed files of the revision
      b. if indexMap does not contain the file name put the file in indexMap and give
         it unique number
   }
3. After step 2 we have seen all the files ever changed and have a unique index for them
   for every revision in revs{
      a. get list of changed files of the revision
      b. now for every key in the indexMap, if the key is in the revision then add
         the file at its proper index according to indexMap.
         For example if indexMap is {A->1, B->2, C->3, D->4} and current revision has
         A and D then create a string "A, ?, ?, D". This is how data is stored in arff.
   }
   Save all the data in proper arff format.

4. create a chart of the data collect
